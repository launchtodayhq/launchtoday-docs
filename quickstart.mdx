## Clone the project

Start by cloning the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:launchtodayhq/launchtoday.git [YOUR_APP_NAME]
```

Alternatively, you can download the source code directly from the latest release:

- [Source code (zip)](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/react-native-boilerplate-upgraded/archive/refs/tags/2.0.1.zip)
- [Source code (tar.gz)](https://github.com/launchtodayhq/react-native-boilerplate-upgraded/archive/refs/tags/2.0.1.tar.gz)

Once complete, run the following commands to install the dependencies and make a copy of the `.env.example` file (we'll be making changes to the copied file later):

```
cd [YOUR_APP_NAME]
yarn
cp.env.example.env
```
