## Quick Recap

LaunchToday is a React Native boilerplate app designed to help startups and indie developers build and launch their mobile apps fast.
It shifts the focus away from extensive setup, incorporating practical features such as authentication, payments, data handling, analytics,
real-time alerts and push notifications.

This boilerplate is organized into two GitHub repositories. The primary repository contains the complete React Native application code (built
with [Expo](https://expo.dev/)) with the following integrations:
 - [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and a Postgres database
 - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) for payments
 - [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for monitoring the health of your app
 - [Segment](https://segment.com/) for analytics
 - [Stream](https://getstream.io/) for chat and video calling features
 - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for push notifications

The secondary repository functions as a backend API service, interacting with the mobile application. It currently supports
processing payments with Stripe and sending push notifications with Firebase and Apple Push Notification Server.
