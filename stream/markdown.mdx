## Introduction

The boilerplate app supports Chat using [Stream](https://getstream.io/) which provides an SDK. Currently the app supports Chat but video and audio
is coming soon. If you need specific support with implementing this, reach out in the discord.


### Prerequisites

This feature depends on an entry in the `profiles` Postgres table in Supabase. If your app needs this feature, ensure you have enabled the onboarding
flow. Alternatively, you can manually insert a row into the said table (along with an avatar image). This ensures that you can message the list of signed
in users in the app
